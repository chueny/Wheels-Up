# Wheels Up
This appplication tracks countries that users have visited and countries they want to visit in the future.  It allows users to search for countries by typing in the name of that country, search by alphabetical order, or search by regions of the world.  When searching by alphabetical order, a country card pops up with country specific information where users can then decide whether to add this country to it's list of places to visit. Users can also take notes on the pros/cons of that country.
